You need 2 things to run InPhyNet:
1. constraint networks on disjoint subsets of taxa
   1. How to select subsets
      1. easy naive method implemented in InPhyNet
      2. smarter method that requires manual intervention
   2. How to do inference once you have subsets
2. pairwise dissimilarity matrix on all taxa
   1. GTs: AGID
   2. MSA: log-det
