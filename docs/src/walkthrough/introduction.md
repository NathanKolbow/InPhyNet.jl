This walkthrough will take you through the steps of generating each piece of data needed to run InPhyNet to infer a 50 taxa network rapidly and accurately. Data used at each step of this walkthrough is available via functions that are built-in to InPhyNet.jl, so feel free to follow along or use your own data instead!

### Requirements:
- Julia installed
- InPhyNet and SNaQ Julia packages installed

### Steps:
1. [Estimate a pairwise distance matrix](d-matrix.md)
2. [Separate your taxa into subsets](subsets.md)
3. [Infer "constraint" networks on your subsets of taxa](constraints.md)
4. [Put it together with InPhyNet](full_net.md)
