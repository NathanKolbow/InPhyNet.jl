InPhyNet.jl is a package for constructing phylogenetic super-networks in `julia`. Methods for estimating explicit phylogenetic networks like [SNaQ](https://crsl4.github.io/PhyloNetworks.jl/latest/man/snaq_plot/#Network-Estimation) and [PhyNEST](https://github.com/sungsik-kong/PhyNEST.jl) optimize over extremely large search spaces, leading to prohibitively long computation times for even as few as 20 taxa. With InPhyNet, sub-networks are estimated on disjoint subsets of taxa and then merged via constrained neighbor joining. This allows accurate estimation of extremely large sets of taxa.
