# NetMerge Abstract

An ever-growing body of research shows the importance of non-vertical inheritance of genetic material in the evolutionary histories of broad classes of species. These non-vertical events are best modelled by explicit phylogenetic networks. Methods for accurately inferring such networks have progressed significantly in the past decade, but remain computational infeasible for all but very small datasets. Here, we present a divide-and-conquer method for feasibly inferring massive and accurate phylogenetic networks with thousands of taxa. Our method uses pre-existing inference methods under-the-hood which can be interchanged easily, allowing (1) the use of any type of input data, and (2) our method's accuracy and runtime to directly benefit from future innovations in inference methods. Moreover, the divide-and-conquer nature of our method makes it highly parallelizable. Simulation studies show that our method's accuracy is proportional to the accuracy of the underlying inference method and that our method obtains accurate results for networks with thousands of taxa in a feasible amount of time.
