First, we find the smallest subset S of names such that all quartets have at least one taxa in the subset. Then, for each entry of S, we gather the set of 3 other taxa it appears with most often in the quartets in R.\n\nThe idea behind these subsets is to guarantee identifiability of hybridizations, hence why they are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"documentation/#InPhyNet.root_constraints!-Tuple{Vector{PhyloNetworks.HybridNetwork}}","page":"Documentation","title":"InPhyNet.root_constraints!","text":"If any constraints are unrooted, picks a root node from any node directly under the root (somewhat randomly).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"documentation/#InPhyNet.sateIIdecomp-Tuple{PhyloNetworks.HybridNetwork, Integer}","page":"Documentation","title":"InPhyNet.sateIIdecomp","text":"Performs subset decomposition as outlined in SATe-II on inittree.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"documentation/#InPhyNet.sateIdecomp-Tuple{PhyloNetworks.HybridNetwork, Integer, Integer}","page":"Documentation","title":"InPhyNet.sateIdecomp","text":"Slightly adjusted implementation of the decomposition algorithm from SATe-I that takes a maximum and a minimum subset size.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"documentation/#InPhyNet.sateIdecomp-Tuple{PhyloNetworks.HybridNetwork, Integer}","page":"Documentation","title":"InPhyNet.sateIdecomp","text":"Performs subset decomposition as outlines in SATe-I on inittree.
