1. Do taxa swapping & random subset robustness sims
2. Meet again and discuss new network topologies w/ Kevin and Claudia
3. Look into methods for comparing networks that are more interpretable than hardwired cluster distance
    - From Kevin: `PhyloNet` has "tripartition dissimilarity" measure that he's not sure if it's reliable or not
    - `PhyloNet` paper also has a lot of references to various methods for comparing networks, including dissimilarity measures
