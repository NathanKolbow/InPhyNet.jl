   1. Ground truth constraints accuracy
   2. NNI noise accuracy
   3.  Distance noise accuracy
   4.  NNI & distance noise accuracy
3.  Algorithm to select partitions w/ data simulated down to sequences
    1.  This is a pipeline: true net → true gts → sequences → est gts → subsetting algorithm → constraint network estimation (w/ model selection for reticulation count) → merged network
